That they were involved in a heist...

I will tell the same to you, sir.

As he was right about everything 
including the name of the serial,

133
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,806
I believed that he would 
pay my electricity bill.

I opened the invitation card out of 
excitement to see who was getting married,

but to my surprise, it was an

I fired the gun not

00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,001
He's our security head.

319
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,418
We have to suspect 
everyone after Roy's death.

320
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,302
Then, what's he still doing here.

321
00:23:55,913 --> 00:24:00,778
[screams]

322
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,938
I want to meet all the board members.

323
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:16,660
Arrange for the meeting.

324
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:24,563
[door creaks]

325
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:28,441
Tea, sir.

326
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:30,064
[clears throat]  
Here.

327
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:31,222
Okay, sir.

328
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:32,724
Go.

329
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,540
Go... Hurry up. 
Move.

330
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,038
I don't understand why this 
private meeting is in a public place.

331
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:43,049
Sir, I'm new. But both of you had 
the history of working together.

332
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:44,168
Start the discussion.

333
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,380
Actually, you are right.

334
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,026
-Ashok, the robbery... 
-Franky speaking, I was called

335
00:24:48,106 --> 00:24:49,877
because you're idiots.

336
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,385
Why do you again include me with you?

337
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,584
I am solo type.

338
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:58,460
It's my bad luck, I have to listen 
to all this just because the I.G. says so.

339
00:24:58,677 --> 00:24:59,450
Here, sir.

340
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:09,279
Amritha Nair.

341
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,076
Kothandam.

342
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:13,451
Sir.

343
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,743
Did you see the 
glittering eyes of this girl?

344
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,121
Her neck... Her haircut.

345
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,362
Out of all, I can see her 
perseverance to nab the robber.

346
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:26,935
How can you see all those 
qualities in such a small photo?

347
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,600
-This girl is okay for me. 
-Sir?

348
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:32,224
I meant I'm ready to work with her team.

349
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,706
Where is she?

350
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:37,811
She's handling Lal Bungalow's case.

351
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,691
[camera clicks]

352
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,251
I've filed the case as 
gang war as you said.

353
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:01,690
Sign here and I'll send 
the corpses to the autopsy, sir.

354
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,709
It is not a gang war. 
They're shot by just one guy.

355
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,388
Look the fallen position of 
the corpses and bullet spots.

356
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:10,513
Everyone got shot at the same 
place. Exactly in their hearts.

357
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,664
Yeah. There seems to be a pattern.

358
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:16,275
The pattern is fine but we need 
proof that there was a fourth guy.

359
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:18,351
Solid copper bullets.

360
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:21,972
Handmade. 
The gun he used was a Glock 25.

361
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:25,269
We can nab the 4th guy if 
we trace the missing gun.

362
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,953
Give us more information, madam.

363
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,662
If you observe the shooting range,

364
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,577
it infers that the killer is a short guy.

365
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:31,873
And moreover he should be

366
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,037
-a professional because... 
-And moreover...

367
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,605
he entered from that door, shot them

368
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,459
and escaped from that window.

369
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,037
It's wrong!

370
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:42,178
[whistles]

371
00:26:47,949 --> 00:26:50,824
He didn't come to deliver a courier so 
that he could ring the doorbell and enter.

372
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:52,494
He's here to commit murder.

373
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,832
He's right. 
He sure must be a higher official.

374
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:56,609
-Sir, please come in. 
-Sir, please...

375
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:58,641
They say 'ladies first', 
but don't give a damn to it!

376
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,533
-Move! 
-Yes, sir.

377
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,511
Madam, please...[footsteps running]

[train whistles]

380
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:33,420
What's this effect, sir?

381
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:35,779
It is the background 
score for this mood.

382
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:36,964
Sir?

383
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:44,035
Sir!

384
00:27:44,568 --> 00:27:47,239
The train left, and 
we're left with the case.

385
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,128
-Look Kothandam. 
-Sir...

386
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:53,382
In a way there is a 
reason behind every crime,

387
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,295
there is a story 
behind every criminal.

388
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:57,503
The story behind this case here is

389
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,465
It was just one guy who fired

390
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,232
but it's not as simple as you think.

391
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,665
[gun cocks]

392
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,220
He pulled out his gun and posed 
a question at the same time.

393
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:19,884
One of those guys got 
alerted upon seeing that

394
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:20,974
and the other guy felt tensed.

395
00:28:21,054 --> 00:28:22,231

00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,956
[screams]

397
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,311
After that, 
he asked him about the third guy.

398
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,152
He will come in sometime.

399
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:35,397
[gunshot]

00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:36,695
[screams]

401
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:43,968
The third guy arrived 
an hour after his death.

402
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:49,228
[indistinct train noise]

He neatly wrapped up the 
work he came for.

Where is the appreciation guys?

408
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:11,422
What you said was superb, sir.[applause]

409
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,227
-Thank you. 
-Superb, sir.

00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:16,440
Oh, sir!

411
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:21,576
Sir. Everything is under 
control, sir. It will be solved.

412
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:23,024
Sir,

413
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:25,173
-I wanted to talk to you about this case 
-Amritha...

414
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:29,701
-Ajay will handle this case from now. 
-Thank you, sir.

415
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,534
I'm sorry, sir.

416
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:37,480
You shift me to another case 
every time, at the last minute.

417
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:40,628
Won't you let me solve the 
case completely, at least once?

418
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:43,234
All the best for the next one.

419

Ashok...

420
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:47,266
Now, I want you to crack 
this one very quickly.

421
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:51,948
-David. 
-Sir.

422
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:54,403
-Kothandam, introduce him with Ashok. 
-Right sir.

423
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,775
Get your old brains and 
come to my new office

424
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,646
at 10 am sharp...

425

It doesn't matter if you're a bit late.

[market sound]

427
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:17,034
Did it come?

428
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:19,183
No, sir.

429
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,699
What about now?

00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,221
No, sir.

[electrical whirring]

433
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,471
It has come.

434
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,888
Welcome, Amritha.

435
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:37,353
What is this, Kothandam?

436
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,134
This is the newly designed 
office for our special mission.

437
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,297
That's our discussion area.

438
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:42,484
That's sit-out area.

-That's our night out area and that's... 
-Stop it.

-I understood. 
-What did you understand?

441
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,214
There is more of useless work 
rather than actual work, in here.

442
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:52,487
[gun shots]

443
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:54,578
How can you forget 
the shooting area, Kothandam?

444
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:56,297
Shooting area does not mean 
film shooting.

445
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:58,123
Everything that you see here isn't true.

446
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:02,060
If at all if there are any genuine 
things, understand them, Amritha ji.

Get me a beer.

00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,345
Sir, how can you think of 
having beer in the morning?

451
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,515
Why are you stretching it so much?

452
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:18,200
Can't we have beers during off duty?

453
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,080
-Moreover, I hail from... 
-Dry state, isn't it?

We got all the CCTV footage related 
to the TRP Jewellery robbery.

00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:39,060
Which camera do you want me to play?

461
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:42,872
Play all the cameras.

462
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:44,702
Check all the footage for the robber.

463
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:46,805
I've got my eyes on camera 1, 
2 and 6.

464
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:48,462

No! This won't work for you. Go.

[machine blips]

469
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,842
That's the footage which 
we've already checked.

470
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:08,889
We've identified every face that we saw 
on CCTV footage and interrogated them.

471
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:14,726
No use.

472
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:25,110
So, you are looking for a face 
that wasn't found in the footage.

473
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,493
The robber might 
have covered her face.

474
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:34,005
I mean... covered his face.

Sir!

Would someone who stole crores of rupees, 
sport a cap or a burka or a sweater?

477
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:44,022
Isn't that cheap logic?

478
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,803
[claps] That's a goal. 
But still, it is a cheap logic.

479
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,637
[glass shatters]

480
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:54,414
[ball knocked and rolls]

481
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,455
Yeah, he might be sporting them. 
He might be having a budget issue.

482
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,955
Hey, search all men wearing burkas 
and women carrying handkerchiefs.

483
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:02,818
-Okay, sir? 
-Shut up.

484
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,612
Sir, there are several guys 
with sporting caps and handkerchiefs.

485
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,483
There are several people 
with their faces covered.

486
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:20,967
What do you want us to do?

487
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:27,086
Why would his dressing style be ordinary 
when his robbery style was extraordinary?

488
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,071
There might be a design or a pattern

489
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,325
or something like a watch 
or might match a shoe...

490
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:34,454
Sir.

491
00:33:35,965 --> 00:33:37,443
You'll slap me when I question but...

492
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,037
Try matching something.

493
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,013
Match shoes and cap 
colours in all cameras.

494
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:45,682
Look at camera number 5.

495
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,249
There's a match!

496
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:52,760
There is a guy whose cap colour 
matches his shoe colour.

497
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:55,288
Finish the game.

498
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:56,938
Play.

499
00:33:57,642 --> 00:33:59,244
Hold it. Hold it.

500
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:07,077
-Preeti, zoom in. 
-Zooming, sir.

501
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,454
Pause. Pause.

502
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,975
We've got him.

503
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,293
We've got him.

504
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:38,658
[phone ringing continuously]

505
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:54,352
I have seen what you sent the details. 
They are very impressive...

506
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:59,437
And also, I've sent you our next plan 
details too. Let me know about it.

507
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:10,330
[air whizzing]

508
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:17,859
[speaking in foreign language]

509
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:20,930
-Jaja, listen to... 
-No, Ibrahim Ji.

510
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:26,629
Is our money safe or not?

511
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,571
I understand all your fears.

512
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:32,719
Roy's son will come and transfer 
all the money within three weeks.

513
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,509
What does he know 
about this organisation?

514
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:39,991
Devaraj, son of Prithviraj, is the 
only rightful heir of that chair.

515
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:45,689
That's not just a chair for someone 
to ascend on it! It's an authority!

516
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,101
And Roy's son is the only 
person who has that authority.

517
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,942
[laughs]

518
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,753
We don't even know if he was 
really born to Roy or someone else.

519
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,076
How can such authority 
be given to him?

520
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:56,698
What do you mean?

521
00:35:56,778 --> 00:35:57,808
I mean,

522
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,543
do you know whether he is 
legitimate or a...

523
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,114
[no audio]

524
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,645
[electricity buzzes]

525
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:08,994
[door opens]

526
00:36:16,098 --> 00:36:18,578
You have unnecessarily 
opened your mouth.

527
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:22,231
Now,if I skin you alive

528
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:25,910
even if all the cobblers 
in the city come together

529
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:27,965
they wouldn't be 
able to stitch it back.

530
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:32,569
Is your tailor still stitching your 
sleeves half and inch longer?

531
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:38,142
Either you change your tailor 
Karim or stop sporting a suit.

532
00:36:38,452 --> 00:36:39,757
It doesn't suit you well

533
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,143
You don't know about me

534
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:50,851
but I know about 
each one of you very well.

535
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:55,007
In fact, I'm the only person who 
knows where the two trillion is.

536
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,678
I think this is enough for 
me to ascend that chair.

537
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,372
I've got two tasks left 
before I ascend this.

538
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:10,503
To start Roy's vision, 
in the way he wanted to

539
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:17,437
and to bring out those who are 
responsible for Roy's death and kill them.

540
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:26,656
What happened in the meeting?

541
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,109
We shall talk about it later.

542
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,943
There is nothing left 
to talk about it later, Mr. Devaraj.

543
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:41,316
It's impossible for you to ascend 
that chair when Roy's son is alive.

544
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:43,469
He seems to be tougher than Roy.

545
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,233
He made everyone shut their 
mouth upon his arrival.

546
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:49,125
And Prince stood like a statue 
watching him talk!

547
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:50,233
[laughs]

548
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:52,387
We almost died unable to laugh.

549
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,756
What do you say, Mr Prithviraj?

550
00:37:56,836 --> 00:37:58,058
[laughs]

551
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:02,189
When Roy was alive, 
everyone was hailing him.

552
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:06,916
And after his death, it's 
his son who everyone is hailing.

553
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,546
Are you laughing about it, father?

554
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:15,035
[spoon clinks]

555
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:23,400
They don't know, father

556
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:28,732
that I could kill and bury them here 
for laughing like that.

557
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:32,670
But you know about me, don't you? 
Should you be laughing?

558
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,500
They don't know, father

559
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:43,352
that it was me who made you confined to 
a wheelchair for denying me that chair.

560
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:45,212
But you know about me, don't you?

561
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,366
Should yyou be laughing?

562
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:50,017
They don't know, father

563
00:38:50,097 --> 00:38:53,029
that it was me who even killed Roy

564
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:56,521
in the middle of the 
road to seize that chair.

565
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:04,799
To bring Roy's organisation under my 
control

566
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:07,889
I grabbed all the money

567
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,002
you know about it, don't you?

568
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:13,580
Should you laugh?

569
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:24,871
Don't worry, father.

570
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:31,151
I won't kill you until you 
see me ascend that chair.

571
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:33,905
Prince,

572
00:39:34,357 --> 00:39:38,771
Tell Roy's son, I'm coming to 
meet him.

573
00:39:51,815 --> 00:39:53,131
Hey John, no!

574
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:55,057
[explosion]

575
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,476
[groaning]

576
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:06,970
Die, you wretches!

577
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:19,758
-Hey! I'll kill you! 
-Listen.

578
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,777
-Hey, let me go... I'll kill him... 
-Come...

579
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:26,007
-I'll kill him... 
-Listen to me. Have you gone mad?

580
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,554
-Look, listen to me... 
-Hey...

581
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,346
First, cool down! Cool down!

582
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:31,976
Look, think like Roy.

583
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:33,867
Look, think like Roy's son.

584
00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:37,790
Well done, Ashok!

585
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,275
I didn't expect 
you to track in a very short time.

586
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,104
At least, we got to know 
how the robber looks like.

587
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:43,680
So, what's your next move?

588
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,469
-Sir, we are planning... 
-Sir...

589
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,157
-You have to look at this. 
-Play this one.

590
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,632
Preethi, just open that one, please.

591
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:03,051
Why is he always holding a 
Viktor coffee cup in his hand?

592
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:04,615
You are exactly right, sir.

593
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:07,680
So, if we immediately log into the 
servers of all the Viktor coffee shops,

594
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,473
-we may find him. 
-It's a waste of time.

595
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:12,290
There's no guarantee 
that he would come there.

596
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,459
But there's no guarantee 
that he wouldn't come either.

597
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:25,388
[phone ringing]

598
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:44,827
We've got a lot of 
artists in our office.

599
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,740
Don't touch my belongings.

600
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:59,611
-Ma'am, can I help you? 
-No need. I can take care of it.

601
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:17,684
Ammu... How come you ended up in the 
police department despite being beautiful?

602
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:18,780
What's your story?

603
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,620
He asked her the very 
question that irritates her.

604
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,401
-I have no such stories. 
-There has to be. How can it not be there?

605
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:28,646
Look at Kothandam, since he had makings of 
a thief since childhood, & he'd get caught

606
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,650
so they made him join the police 
department.

607
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,813
Look at David. He looks like a crook. 
So they didn't risk it at his house too.

608
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,535
I don't have such stories.

609
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:39,133
Let me know if you know 
anything. I'll listen.

610
00:42:40,617 --> 00:42:44,118
Your attire from top to bottom are 
of light colours and less jewellery.

611
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:48,114
Your shoes have more 
polish than your fingernails do.

612
00:42:50,055 --> 00:42:52,007
Receiving no phone calls or 
messages since morning infer that

613
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:55,648
you talk to few people. 
And you trust fewer.

614
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:01,542
As you are afraid to 
face society on your own,

615
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,206
you are hiding behind 
the mask of the police.

616
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:06,860
Instead of coming out 
of your emotional weakness,

617
00:43:08,354 --> 00:43:09,815
you've built a wall around you.

618
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:11,023
It is like

619
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:18,092
the way you stop your tears 
despite you feel like crying.

620
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:23,780
Kothandam, you have to 
be very careful with him.

621
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:27,853
Preethi, zoom camera 2. Zoom in...

622
00:43:30,803 --> 00:43:33,610
Go back. Back... Back... Back... Stop!

623
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:37,520
Sir!

624
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:40,830
This coffee shop is 
right next to us, sir.

625
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:44,508
-Let's get him. 
-Okay, sir.

626
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,942
Get the tracker.

627
00:43:46,233 --> 00:43:47,872
Gate B, 3rd floor, guys!

628
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:49,973
David, stay here.

629
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:56,525
[tyres screech]  
Stop the car.

630
00:43:56,605 --> 00:43:58,260
I think they got some lead, sir.

631
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:13,752
[phone ringing]

632
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:19,829
I know that place. 
It's an event called ARMANI.

633
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:26,864
Hello? Who are you?

634
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,080
Excuse me. 
We are from Mumbai Crime Branch.

635
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,438
-Tell me. 
-Where is the 2nd floor CCTV footage?

636
00:44:30,518 --> 00:44:31,568
-Show it. 
-Sure, sir.

637
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:34,250
A... R... M... A...

638
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,007
[indistinct people chatter]

639
00:45:00,337 --> 00:45:02,087
Preethi, check the CCTV.

640
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,173
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:06,013
Let the game begin.

642
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,435
Entrance camera!

643
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:15,980
I don't think he is here.

644
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:19,890
Ma'am, the server over here is down.

645
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:23,463
Not just here, sir. All the CCTV 
servers in the mall are down.

646
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:26,974
As far as I know, 
he didn't come here.

647
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:28,545
Ashok!

648
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,092
Cappuccino for Ashok!

649
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:35,130
Table number 3, right?

650
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,917
Someone has left coffee for you.

651
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,172
Armani...

652
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,218
What could his next plan be?

653
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,438
The ship has sunk.

654
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:20,773
Are you thinking how 
to get the money now?

655
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,226
Take right.

656
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:37,619
Only Ibrahim and I know 
about this building.

657
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:40,501
It is the most secured 
building in Waaji.

658
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,705
There is more money in 
here, than what we lost.

659
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:11,028
Please insert the Black Box.

660
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:15,309
But there is only one key 
that can open this.

661
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:17,933
that is Black Box.

662
00:47:19,034 --> 00:47:21,892
But that's not here.

663
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,257
Then, where is it?

664
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:28,927
After Roy died, we had to hide the 
Black Box in a safe place in Mumbai.

665
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:32,552
-So, I will go and get it. 
-No!

666
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,109
If you were with Roy on that day,

667
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:39,902
Roy would have been with Viswak today.

668
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:42,320
You should stay with Vishwak.

669
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:43,940
I'll go.

670
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:54,990
This is the event which is happening 
after a long time in the city.

671
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,452
That is why we have 
to talk to the organisers

672
00:47:56,532 --> 00:47:58,938
and get the complete 
surveillance under our control.

673
00:47:59,018 --> 00:48:02,081
Once we spot him, we 
shouldn't let him loose.

674
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:03,177
Sure, ma'am.

675
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:05,341
I think we are very 
close to solving it.

676
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:07,613
The boy kissed the girl.

677
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:13,524
And they lived happily together

678
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:15,035
ever after.

679
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,055
Do you find what I'm saying funny?

680
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:21,799
What would your reaction 
be if he is in front of you?

681
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:22,991
Reaction?

682
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:25,544
-I will put him behind bars. 
-Okay!

683
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,258
We know he did all those robberies.

684
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,445
But do we at least 
a single evidence to prove that?

685
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:31,619
[tongue twist]

686
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:33,650
-We don't sir. 
-Then, what do we do?

687
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:36,269
Sometimes, we nab a criminal 
before he commits a crime

688
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,537
and sometimes, after he does. 
But...

689
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:41,722
But in our case, 
we have to catch him in the act.

690
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:43,018
Right.

691
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:47,393
So, we have to follow the robber 
like a robber and know his plan.

692
00:48:47,473 --> 00:48:48,499
Right.

693
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:52,359
We have to follow 
that plan and nab him.

694
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:54,742
Right...

695
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:02,084
Are you getting tempted?

696
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:05,915
Mm, hmm.

697

00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:08,786

-We're going to a pub tomorrow. 
-Okay, sir.

701
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,894
-Tell her not to wear a wedding dress. 
-She won't, sir.

Just keep a check 
on all the CCTV cameras.

704
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:30,653
Okay, sir. I will take care of it.

705
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,837
Something is missing in my life, 
Kothandam.

706
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:34,293
What do you lack?

707
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:35,610
You've got robbers to catch.

708
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,612
They've given you us to play with. 
What else do you want?

709
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:42,592
That is what. Violence... 
There is too much violence.

710
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:46,385
-Beyond that..something... 
-Romance?

711
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:48,610
Yeah. I want romance.[door opens]

would have been better.

Hi!

716
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:19,977
Don't you think the 
dress is a bit much?

717
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:24,323
It has to be this way. Otherwise, 
they'll know that we're police.

be wary about the placement of badge.

I can't tell you.

It's a secret. What about you?

-It's an antique. 
-Can I see it?

794
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:22,046
It would only have looked more 
beautiful if I had its missing part.

795
00:56:24,788 --> 00:56:28,223
There is a reason for 
talking to you privately.

796
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:30,591
Roy Group!

797
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:34,310
It is the world's most 
powerful crime syndicate.

798
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,669
These are not their criminal records.

799
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:40,643
These are details of the people 
who wanted to stop their crimes.

800
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:44,067
There wasn't any use.

801
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:49,299
But... the Black Box that 
you are talking about...

802
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:51,541
if we could get hold of it...

803
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,948
then, we can stop the Roy 
Group from coming to India.

804
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:02,560
He gave us a bigtime 
information in inebriation.

805
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:11,658
No. He knows about me very well.

806
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:14,369
That is why he told me.

807
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:17,631
He threw a challenge to catch him.

808
00:57:19,258 --> 00:57:23,400
But what he doesn't know 
is that I will spare no one.

[footsteps]

810
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:35,678
Ashok...

811
00:57:38,399 --> 00:57:42,378
Do you genuinely have any 
use of me, in this case?

812
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:46,754
Because you've already have 
answers to all the questions.

813
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,758
But this time, it is just 
the answers that I have.

814
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:52,608
You have to find out 
what the question is.

815
00:57:54,663 --> 00:57:56,190
You are in my team, Amritha.

816
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,972
If anyone has to yell at you, 
it should be me. Not someone else.

817
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:01,922
He should take his words back.

818
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:09,966
These are the flights 
coming from Waaji.

819
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:14,307
Passengers list?

820
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,434
There you go.

821
00:58:18,186 --> 00:58:19,974
Shortlist the business class.

822
00:58:25,788 --> 00:58:27,329
Total 20 passengers.

823
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:30,770
If we remove 5 female passengers 
from the list, then we are left with 15.

824
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,905
Wait!

825
00:58:33,632 --> 00:58:35,367
I just need the list of the five 
female passengers.

from Stanford and a Doctorate from Oxford.

She is currently the Chief Economic 
Advisor for the Waaji government.

829
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,281
After her father, Gopala Chary's death,

830
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:57,618
she became the legal 
advisor for the Roy Group.

Cotton Exchange and it finally 
stopped in Ballard Pier.

In front of the Capital bank.

879
01:04:00,108 --> 01:04:03,432
[shutter clicks]  
So, it's in Capital bank.

01:04:03,512 --> 01:04:04,722
No, sir.

01:04:10,103 --> 01:04:12,803
-Alright, back to the office. 
-No.

Guys, we should follow Kalki.

01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,898
Yes, ma'am. How can I help you, madam?

-No, thank you. 
-Okay.

01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:27,807
What is she doing at the pharmacy?

886
01:04:27,887 --> 01:04:30,144
From there we've followed her again.

887
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:57,096
The Black Box is not in the Capital bank,

888
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,410
but it's in the Royal bank, 
behind that medical shop.

889
01:05:07,296 --> 01:05:11,489
How will the thief come to the bank 
if he doesn't know about this?

890
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,964
How will we catch him?

891
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:17,924
He is a thief, 
not a cop to know it late.

892
01:05:19,132 --> 01:05:21,077
He will always be ahead of us.

893
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:31,106
Well done, Amritha. 
Sorry, I take back my words.

894
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:39,892
Are you going to make me 
walk till the office?

895
01:05:39,972 --> 01:05:41,005
Where is the car?

896
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:46,666
Oh, my God! 
You've been going good till now.

897
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,841
Why are you so upset suddenly?

898
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,289
When I was young, one day,

899
01:05:54,459 --> 01:05:58,582
my mother was learning to drive 
and drove the car quite fast.

900
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:03,429
Even though my father, who 
was sitting next to her was tensed,

901
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:07,564
I was screaming for her to go faster 
from the back seat.

902
01:06:09,914 --> 01:06:12,327
Suddenly the car hit the divider

903
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,536
and rolled over.

904
01:06:18,128 --> 01:06:19,581
It was a complete blackout.

905
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:22,969
When I opened my eyes, 
I saw blood everywhere.

906
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:28,078
My parents were staring at me 
without saying a word.

907
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:34,960
My life which was passing happily 
till then, turned upside down.

908
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,670
I'm happy after several days.

909
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:46,638
I am scared that I might lose 
this happiness too.

910
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:51,873
You were right about me, Ashok.

911
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:55,375
Whether I have happiness or sorrow 
in my life,

912
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,949
I have no one to share

913
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:04,217
except my shadow.

914
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:17,284
Now you don't even have your shadow.

915
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,926
But I'm here, will alway be.

916
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:23,545
Even I don't have anyone

917
01:07:25,434 --> 01:07:26,733

Will you tell me my future?

It's not yours but ours.

Beautiful. I think it's costly.

I sold such a big car and it 
fetched me this small ring. [scoffs]

including bank blueprints,

01:11:34,994 --> 01:11:37,412
There... 
That's where the main entrance is.

952
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:41,068
It is not as easy as they 
think to enter this bank.

953
01:11:41,148 --> 01:11:46,026
That area control rooms will be alerted, 
if they try to open the main door.

954
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:49,146
After you cross that, you'd find a 
CCTV camera at every foot of that place.

955
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:52,039
And then the high voltage 
electricity laser tags.

956
01:11:52,405 --> 01:11:54,797
And finally the locker.

01:11:55,347 --> 01:11:56,846
The vault.

958
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,322
It's impossible to open this vault.

959
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:03,100
That is why, 
we will make it possible for him.

01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:08,435

-Here, we need the thief

and also the Black Box 
which he wants to steal.

962
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,017
So we have to think oppositely.

963
01:12:13,097 --> 01:12:14,973
Whatever he expected should 
never happen, no matter what.

964
01:12:15,053 --> 01:12:19,238
So, we will provide him 
entry to the locker room.

965
01:12:19,318 --> 01:12:22,339
Upon realising there's nothing 
inside, he'll understand that

966
01:12:22,419 --> 01:12:24,508
we have already acquired the Black Box. 
Am I right, sir?

967
01:12:25,432 --> 01:12:28,005
Off the record, the case will be closed.

968
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:30,857
That Black box is 
very important to us.

I can be your bad girl."

If the celebration is of this scale,

1116

I heard that the Franco brothers 
fears nothing.

1122
01:31:13,645 --> 01:31:15,305
With these guys around them,

1123
01:31:15,815 --> 01:31:18,746
they will never know what fear really is.

1124
01:31:18,826 --> 01:31:20,572
If you guys are on our side,

1125
01:31:21,021 --> 01:31:24,689
the board members too 
will come to our side out of fear.

1126
01:31:26,352 --> 01:31:31,656
After that, Devaraj will 
eventually take over the chair.

1127
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,172
Roy's son is back.

1128
01:31:34,562 --> 01:31:36,762
Why do we need Devaraj now?

1129
01:31:37,133 --> 01:31:42,285
First, make arrangements to get 
all the money out of his lockers.

1130
01:31:42,365 --> 01:31:45,346
After that, 
you can go and sit on his chair.

What work does he have apart from 
riding a camel on the desert?

This might be a desert for you.

We lost the Black box.

We have only two weeks left.

1143

The lost device has a tracking system.

1144

For the next 48 hours...

it can be seen on this screen.

What a place this is, brother!

Surrounded by girls and 
beer in our hands. Wow!

1149
01:33:38,185 --> 01:33:40,745
It would be nice if we 
settle down in this place.

Stay here. 
I will come back and tell you.

Take your time, brother. No problem.

The magazine is empty dear.

Do you think I will come with just 
one magazine even after knowing you?

1173
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:21,545
The police brain too has become 
sharp after staying with a thief.

It of no use shooting you here.

1175
01:35:24,331 --> 01:35:26,108
Because there is nothing in there.

1176

Everything is in here.

and you were in a similar situation...

What would you do?

1181
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,991

A small confusion.

I'm sure it is 105. I swear.

It was then that I understood...

A story that you and Roy 
wanted to know since a long time.

1636
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:47,761
The story's name is Karana.

A village full of people.

Under that village, 
lay an unimaginable ocean of oil

We threatened the people 
to leave the city.

But because of Roy's support, 
no one listened to us.
